# Codecademy Summer 2020 Java Projects

The projects in this repository are short projects that I completed from Codecademy using a Pro Trial Subscription.
I decided to further consolidate my understanding of Java after completing my 1st Year of Computer Science at QMUL London.

I have planned to complete lots of programming projects in the the summer holidays and reading ahead to prepare me for Year 2 of Computer Science. I hope that doing these projects will show my capability for ongoing learning and master skills.
